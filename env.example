# GitHub Configuration
# Option 1: Single token (simplest)
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here

# Option 2: Multiple tokens (for working across multiple projects with fine-grained PATs)
# Comma-separated list of tokens. When --post is used, each token is tested for write access
# and the first one that works is used. This is useful if you have separate fine-grained PATs
# for different repositories. Takes precedence over GITHUB_TOKEN for write operations.
